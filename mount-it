# Mount CIFS shares. I have a really old NAS but it still works, but it uses V1. Uncomment what you need
# and change the username and password to what you need. CAUTION: If you are on a production system
# the credentials should be stored in a seperate file readable by root only as /etc/fstab is world readable.
